This is a demo for consuming Miro's implementation of the oEmbed spec in order to provide a frictionless embed experience for Miro boards.

## Getting Started

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/autodiscover](http://localhost:3000/api/autodiscover). This endpoint can be edited in [`pages/api/autodiscover.ts`](./pages/api/autodiscover.ts).

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
